*Jeremy Kay Blog*

Instead of relying on WordPress, I'll create my own blog to use for my personal site. This is what Rails is supposed to be great at, right?

I realize it's more of an exercise, but really it's just for my own practice...to learn Rails more, and to get something I can customize and use.
